Introduction  
---  
Google script designed to help manage batches of homemade food that has been processed to extend its shelf life. 

This script interacts with a "Google Spreadsheet" I've written a seperate readme that documents the "[Pantry Spreadsheet]()". Within this spreadsheet you keep track of your preserve batches, dates, yield, stock, and other useful information about the preserves you create. The script then scans the spreadsheet to create and send email alerts before the "best by" date, on the "best by" date, and on the estimated expiration date. "Best by" and expiration dates can be customized within the spreadsheet.

Setup   
---  

1. Make a copy of the Pantry Spreadsheet for your own Drive. 
2. Near the bottom of the script replace youremail@gmail.com with your gmail address. 
3. Run the script from the menu at the top to setup permissions.
4. Click on the clock icon in the menu and setup a trigger for pantryHelper. I like to set up a time-driven day timer to run from 1-2am. 
5. Start using the spreadsheet. Read the spreadsheet README to learn more about the spreadsheet.
